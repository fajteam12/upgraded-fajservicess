              <ul className="text-light" style={{ paddingLeft: '20px' }}>
                <li><strong>Clean the grill:&nbsp;</strong>Inspect and clean your barbecue if it&apos;s been outside for a while. Even after use, it&apos;s a good idea to clean and dry it. Always follow the manufacturer's maintenance instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>Cooking on Charcoal:&nbsp;</strong>If using charcoal instead of gas, make sure the coals are glowing red with a grey, powdery surface before cooking.</li>
                <li><strong>Defrosting Meat:&nbsp;</strong>Frozen meat can cook unevenly on a BBQ. For best results, defrost it overnight in a lipped dish in the fridge. If you&apos;re short on time, use the microwave's defrost setting. Cook and eat the meat within 24 hours of defrosting.</li>
                <li><strong>Check the Use-by Dates:&nbsp;</strong>The use-by date on food packaging is important for safety, as consuming food past this date can cause illness. Best before dates indicate quality; while food is safe to eat after this date, it may not taste as good.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook BBQ Meat Properly:&nbsp;</strong>Properly cooking food at the right temperature and time is crucial to eliminate harmful bacteria. Different meats have specific cooking requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Serving Food Safely at a BBQ:&nbsp;</strong>To ensure food safety, use separate raw meat, cooked meat, and ready-to-eat foods, such as salads. Store these items in the fridge or in a cool bag with ice packs until it&apos;s time to serve. Keep any cool items out of direct sunlight until serving.</li>
                <li><strong>Bacteria and Cross Contamination:&nbsp;</strong>Leftover food on your grill poses serious risks. Bacteria can grow on old residue and contaminate new food. Additionally, cross-contamination with allergenic foods, like last night&rsquo;s fish, could lead to severe consequences, such as anaphylactic shock..</li>
                <li><strong>Rust Prevention:&nbsp;</strong>Your grills are made of metal, so if you don&rsquo;t clean them often, they will rust&mdash;especially cast iron. Regular cleaning will help prolong their lifespan.</li>
